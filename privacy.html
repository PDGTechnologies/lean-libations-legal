<h1>Lean Libations Privacy Policy</h1>
<small>Effective Date: January 1, 2026</small>

<p>Lean Libations is a product of PDG Technologies (“PDG Technologies,” “we,” “our,” or “us”).</p>

<p>Lean Libations is designed as a privacy-first, local decision companion. We do not require user accounts, we do not sell personal data, and we do not track users across apps or services.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains what information may be transmitted when you use the app, how it is used, and how it is protected.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p>Lean Libations does not create user accounts and does not collect personal identifiers such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, precise location data, or contact lists.</p>

<p>The only information transmitted off your device is described below.</p>

<h3>Menu Photos (Scan Feature)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A photo of the menu is captured within the app</li>
  <li>The image is securely transmitted to a third-party AI service (Google Gemini)</li>
  <li>The image is processed to extract text</li>
  <li>The extracted text is returned to your device</li>
</ul>

<p>Lean Libations does not store or retain the submitted image.</p>

<p>Image transmission is required for the scan feature to function.</p>

<p>Menu images are processed ephemerally and are not retained by PDG Technologies after the request is completed.</p>

<h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>

<h3>Google Gemini API</h3>

<p>Lean Libations uses Google’s Gemini API to perform optical character recognition and menu analysis.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Images are transmitted securely using encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS)</li>
  <li>Lean Libations does not store images</li>
  <li>Processing is limited strictly to providing scan functionality</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>

<p>Lean Libations offers optional Premium access through Apple App Store or Google Play Billing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>All payments are processed by Apple or Google</li>
  <li>PDG Technologies does not receive or store payment card information</li>
  <li>Subscription management is handled through your Apple or Google account settings</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Local Data Storage</h2>

<p>Lean Libations is designed to operate locally by default.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Preferences and app settings are stored on your device</li>
  <li>We do not maintain user accounts</li>
  <li>We do not maintain user profiles</li>
  <li>We do not operate a user data database</li>
</ul>

<p>If you uninstall the app, locally stored data is removed from your device.</p>

<h2>5. Analytics and Tracking</h2>

<p>Lean Libations does not display advertisements.</p>
<p>Lean Libations does not sell personal data.</p>
<p>Lean Libations does not track users across apps or services.</p>

<p>If analytics or additional data collection features are introduced in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated prior to release.</p>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>

<p>All data transmitted off-device is encrypted in transit using HTTPS/TLS.</p>

<p>Lean Libations is intentionally designed to minimize data collection and reduce privacy exposure.</p>

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>Lean Libations is not directed toward children under the age of 13.</p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

<h2>8. Your Rights</h2>

<p>Because Lean Libations does not create user accounts or store personal data, there is no user profile data to access, modify, or delete.</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>PDG Technologies may update this Privacy Policy as Lean Libations evolves.</p>

<p>If data collection practices change, this policy will be updated before those changes are released.</p>
